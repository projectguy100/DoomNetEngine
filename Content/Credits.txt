@ProjectGuy100 - Most of the html code is made by me and the JavaScript is made by me. Added most of links, most sites are made by me. Ideas and update planning are by me.
@TheGeek1307 - Styled it with CSS and added some Website links to the Engine, also added all the good banners and Icons, fixed some of html code.
@syan212 - Added a bunch of sites to search and searchable sites and did kind of screw up a bit but it was a minor issue(no comma crashed EVERYTHING).
